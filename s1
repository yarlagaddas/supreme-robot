Here’s a clear, professional, no-excuses, priority-focused version you can send to your manager. It explains the situation honestly and shows accountability without sounding defensive:

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I wanted to give some context on the limited progress with the Jest framework work. Over the last few weeks, my focus has been on completing the February release stories up until code freeze, alongside the release version upgrade—both of which were top-priority and time-sensitive.

After the freeze, we moved straight into the Angular version update and addressing the resulting defects, which has continued to require immediate attention. Because of these parallel priorities, I haven’t yet had a clear window to start the Jest framework work.

Now that the Angular update is stabilizing, I can plan dedicated time to begin work on Jest and provide a more concrete update going forward.

Please let me know if you’d like me to reprioritize or break this into smaller milestones.

Thanks,
Subha

If you want:
	•	a more concise version
	•	a more assertive / leadership-tone version
	•	or a Slack-style casual version

tell me the tone and I’ll tailor it exactly.


Got it — here it is rewritten in a very natural, first-person “me” tone, like you’re explaining it yourself (not polished/corporate, but still professional):

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I wanted to share some context on why I haven’t made much progress on the Jest framework work yet. I’ve been focused on completing the February release stories up until code freeze, along with the release version upgrade, since both were top-priority items.

After the freeze, we immediately started working on the Angular version update and fixing the related defects, which has continued to take priority. Because of this, I didn’t really get a window to start on the Jest work.

Now that things are settling down on the Angular side, I can start planning time to pick up Jest and move it forward.

Thanks,
Subha

If you want it to sound:
	•	a bit more confident
	•	slightly shorter
	•	or more direct / action-oriented

say the word and I’ll adjust it exactly to your style.
