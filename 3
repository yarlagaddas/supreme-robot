supported this goal by providing disciplined release coordination and applying RM standards to ensure consistent execution across the initiatives under my scope. This included validating release readiness, confirming scope alignment, and maintaining clear, time-aware communication across engineering, product, support teams, and dependent applications. I maintained oversight of integration touchpoints, data dependencies, and sequencing requirements to reduce variability and protect business continuity during deployment windows. These practices reinforced stakeholder confidence in our release process and supported predictable delivery outcomes.

As part of this responsibility, I provided release coordination and communication support for all AU initiatives, including Telstra propositions, Harvey Norman initiatives, and JB Hi-Fi initiatives, as well as US efforts spanning AT&T RL Returns Management, Verizon, and API integration activities. I facilitated standing alignment touchpoints with key members and delivery leads, tracked go/no-go indicators, and ensured stakeholders received clear impact or no-impact updates throughout deployment and validation. I also coordinated with client teams to support client testing cycles and post-validation confirmation, helping to verify successful outcomes and enabling smooth progression into business usage. This structured approach strengthened confidence in delivery outcomes and supported stable, on-schedule rollout of client and product enhancements.
